Fourier Transforms
=====================

This repo contains an implementation of the discrete fourier transform, and a
fast fourier transform implementation using the Cooley-Tukey algorithm.

The two functions in fourier.h are

void dft(double complex * fdom, double complex * tdom, int n, int s);
void fft(double complex * fdom, double complex * tdom, int n, int s);

Each function calculates the transform for the time domain tdom and places
the results in the complex double array fdom. The integer n is the size of the
array. The integer s is the stride of the array, which is used in the 
recursive part of the fft. If you are calling this, you should set s to 1. 
For accurate results for the fft, it is best to use an input array with a size 
that is a power of 2.
